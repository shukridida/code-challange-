GRADING SYTSEM
*ABOUT THE GRADING SYSTEM*
The program defines a function 'calculateGrade' that calculates the grade based on the input marks and specified grade ranges.
The 'main' function takes the input marks using 'LET', calls 'calculateGrade', and displays the corresponding grade using 'console.log'.
# Grade Ranges
A: Greater than 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: Less than 40
$$
OUTCOME;
$$
For marks greater than 79, it prints: "Grade: A".
For marks between 60 and 79, it prints: "Grade: B".
For marks between 50 and 59, it prints: "Grade: C".
For marks between 40 and 49, it prints: "Grade: D".
For marks less than 40, it prints: "Grade: E".



**Speed Detector **
This JavaScript program takes the speed of a car as input and calculates demerit points based on the specified criteria. It then prints the appropriate message according to the number of demerit points.
GUIDES
The program defines a function calculateDemeritPoints that calculates demerit points based on the input speed and a predefined speed limit.
The main function takes the input speed, calls calculateDemeritPoints, and logs the appropriate message based on the demerit points.
Example :
If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints: "Ok".
If the speed is greater than or equal to 70 km/h, it calculates and prints the demerit points.
If the demerit points exceed 12, it prints: "License suspended".



NET SALARY
**salary calculation**

These are the steps followed to calculate net salary:

Define Hypothetical Tax Rates:
Hypothetical tax rates are used for tax, NHIF deductions, and NSSF deductions. These rates should be replaced with actual rates obtained from reliable sources.

Calculate Gross Salary:
The gross salary is calculated by adding the basic salary and benefits.

Calculate Tax:
Tax is calculated based on the tax rate and the gross salary.

Calculate NHIF Deductions:
NHIF deductions are calculated based on the NHIF rate and the gross salary.

Calculate NSSF Deductions:
NSSF deductions are calculated based on the NSSF rate and the gross salary.

Calculate Net Salary:
The net salary is calculated by subtracting the total deductions (tax, NHIF, and NSSF) from the gross salary.

Usage
To calculate the net salary for an individual:

Open the JavaScript file where the calculateNetSalary function is defined.

Call the calculateNetSalary function, passing the basic salary and benefits as arguments. For example:

javascript

const basicSalary = 59000; // Basic salary in KES
const benefits = 4500; // Benefits in KES
const result = calculateNetSalary(basicSalary, benefits); // Calculate net salary
Run the program and observe the output. It will display the gross salary, tax, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and net salary for the provided inputs.
